# Maintainer release guide

[README](../README.md) · [Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md) · [Security](../SECURITY.md) · [Changelog](../CHANGELOG.md)

This guide is for repository maintainers qualifying and publishing an Action release. A successful run proves only the exact commit SHA it tested. After any candidate change, repeat every required check against the new latest SHA.

v0.8.2 is a reliability and maintenance release over the existing controlled
and experimental native compositions. It keeps the
audited DSH `0.1.1-rc.2` family exact-pinned and does not add Session/Resume, an
Action-owned GitHub MCP backend, or another GitHub capability. Its formal
annotated tag, GitHub Release, and release canary must resolve to the same
qualified exact-main commit. The independently versioned installer remains
`0.2.0` with its formal v0.8.0 Action binding until the separate `0.2.1`
companion is reviewed and published after v0.8.2 qualification. Never substitute
a guessed Action SHA while preparing that companion.

## Release invariants

- Work from the latest `main`; the release tag and GitHub Release must ultimately resolve to the same immutable commit.
- Keep the Action version, DSH version, package manifest/lock, metadata, examples, documentation, canary, and committed `dist/` aligned.
- Never hand-edit `dist/`. Build it from source and review the generated diff.
- Keep every directly used `@deepseek-ai/dsh*` package exactly pinned. Do not use `latest`, ranges, floating Git refs, mixed package-family versions, or peer/lock bypass flags.
- Keep Action checkouts pinned with `persist-credentials: false`.
- Keep the real GitHub token and DeepSeek key outside the Agent, repository code, validation, and extensions.
- Publish installer templates only after replacing their controlled build token
  with the full commit SHA resolved from the formal release tag. A candidate or
  guessed SHA is not a production Action reference.
- A published tag is immutable. If its formal smoke fails, do not move the tag; fix forward with the next patch release.

The release constants and direct DSH package inventory live in [`src/release.ts`](../src/release.ts). Public Action input metadata lives in [`src/action-contract.ts`](../src/action-contract.ts); run `npm run generate:action-contract` after changing it. [`scripts/verify-release-contract.mjs`](../scripts/verify-release-contract.mjs) checks the release constants against the manifest, lock, Action metadata, CI runtime smoke, and release canary, while `npm run test:generated` rejects generated input metadata drift.

## Repository environments and variables

Before qualification, configure the `core-e2e` environment:

1. Limit deployment to the default branch.
2. Add `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` to that environment.
3. Do not expose the secret to the gate jobs; the workflows bind trusted identities before entering the environment.

Both pre-merge and post-merge Core E2E use repository variable `DSH_E2E_CANDIDATE_SHA`. The release canary uses `DSH_RELEASE_CANARY_SHA`. Each must be a lowercase, full 40-character commit SHA for its current purpose.

## Local qualification

Use Node.js 24 and a clean dependency installation:

```bash
npm ci
npm run check
```

`npm run check` runs formatting, lint, type checking, coverage tests, the release-contract check, the DSH configuration audit, and a deterministic `dist` build comparison. Do not skip a failing sub-check.

v0.8.2 retains the deterministic invariant/model matrix across composition
mode, trust, permission profile, isolation, extension authority, and Controller
GitHub authority. Use that matrix for cross-axis policy coverage and reserve
live E2E for the representative high-value paths below; do not attempt a live
Cartesian product.

For v0.8.2, the DSH audit also proves that the exact headless package still
accepts only one text task and creates one text content block. That negative
contract is release evidence for deferring GitHub attachment images; do not
remove it unless a replacement exact DSH multimodal contract and its security
review ship together.

Before committing, inspect the complete diff and confirm that only intended source, test, metadata, documentation, and generated bundle changes are present. For a documentation-only PR, verify explicitly that `src/`, `dist/`, runtime assets, `action.yml`, and package files did not change.

## Version and DSH update checklist

For an Action version bump, update every release surface together:

1. `ACTION_VERSION` / `ACTION_TAG` in `src/release.ts`.
2. `package.json` and the root versions in `package-lock.json`.
3. Release references in `action.yml`, README files, examples, and `CHANGELOG.md`.
4. The release canary workflow name and `RELEASE_TAG`.
5. `dist/`, generated through the normal build.
6. Any release-specific verification fixture or documentation.

The standalone `create-deepseek-harness-action` package has its own semantic
version. Its v0.8.0 companion release is `0.2.0`; do not change it to the Action
version. Keep its package manifest, npm lock/workspace metadata, CLI tests,
controlled/native templates, and pack-time release-SHA contract aligned. The
formal v0.8.0 Action binding is
`86fff4c4527694c7eefdc65c6cf7a633b5ea8cb1`.

For a DSH version bump, additionally:

1. Confirm the complete official npm package family is published and that ordinary `npm ci` succeeds with peer and lock validation intact.
2. Update `DSH_VERSION` and every package in `DIRECT_DSH_PACKAGES` to the same exact version, then regenerate the lock normally.
3. Audit the real upstream change range for app-boot, Profile/Bundle/Plugin composition, MCP, ToolRuntime, Bash, Web Search, Subagent, receipts, Docker/path/timeout handling, and the bundled Action entrypoint.
4. Revalidate the controlled Profile, native tool inventory and official ecosystem (MCP, Profile Bundle, Cordis Plugin, project Skills, Subagent, and Workflow), permission intersections, credential routing, extension locks, runtime reuse, receipts, and cleanup boundaries.
5. Add compatibility and security regression coverage before running the real golden paths.

If the official package family is incomplete or clean `npm ci` cannot consume it, do not use `--legacy-peer-deps`, mix versions, or weaken the lock audit. Leave the current exact DSH pin in place and defer the upgrade.

The [DSH upstream compatibility canary](../.github/workflows/dsh-upstream-canary.yml)
runs weekly and on manual dispatch. It independently selects the newest
official stable and RC candidates newer than the audited production pin by
semantic version, excluding alpha/deprecated builds and RCs already superseded
by the selected stable release. Each candidate uses a separate temporary
directory containing copies of the relevant source and fixtures, with a fresh
complete dependency installation. Candidate DSH packages use one exact version;
Cordis requirements come from that candidate's official dependency graph.
Installation uses strict peer validation, followed by a lock inventory audit and
`npm ls`; mixed DSH versions or multiple Cordis runtimes prevent the smoke.
The production manifest, lockfile and support range remain unchanged.

Reports distinguish `not-tested`, `install-failed`, `interface-incompatible`,
and `passed`. Missing candidates, failed selection, and an interrupted,
timed-out, or unstartable smoke are `not-tested`; dependency resolution,
installation, or graph-validation failures are `install-failed`. Only a
completed failing smoke is `interface-incompatible`, and a skipped smoke is
never compatibility evidence. The stable and RC jobs retain independent JSON
reports, candidate manifests/locks, and bounded install/test logs as artifacts,
including partial logs during interruption. The jobs are advisory and
non-gating, never a production upgrade, release gate, or declaration of support.

## Pull request and candidate CI

1. Create a focused release branch from the latest `main`.
2. Run the local qualification commands.
3. Commit and push all source, test, documentation, metadata, lock, and generated `dist` changes together as applicable.
4. Open a PR to `main` and let [CI](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) run on the latest PR head.
5. Resolve every failure. Any new commit invalidates the old CI result; wait for CI on the new head.

Record the exact candidate identity:

```bash
candidate_sha="$(gh pr view "$pr_number" --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid)"
test "${#candidate_sha}" -eq 40
```

The candidate PR must be open, non-draft, same-repository, and target the default branch.

## Core E2E

The permanent [Core E2E workflow](../.github/workflows/e2e.yml) is trusted release harness code and must already exist on the live default branch. Its secretless gate requires a write-capable actor and binds all of the following before any secret-bearing job starts:

- the workflow and dispatch SHA equal the live default-branch SHA;
- `candidate_sha` is either the current full PR head SHA or, in protected post-merge mode, the live default-branch SHA;
- `DSH_E2E_CANDIDATE_SHA` equals that SHA; and
- pull-request mode binds an open, non-draft, same-repository PR based on the default branch, while main mode rejects a PR number and requires the candidate, dispatch, workflow, and live default-branch SHAs to be identical.

For pre-merge qualification, set the candidate variable and dispatch the trusted workflow from `main` in pull-request mode:

```bash
gh variable set DSH_E2E_CANDIDATE_SHA --body "$candidate_sha"
gh workflow run e2e.yml --ref main \
  -f candidate_mode=pull-request \
  -f candidate_sha="$candidate_sha" \
  -f pull_request="$pr_number"
```

Harness files and fixtures are checked out at the trusted default-branch SHA. Candidate Action code is checked out separately at the bound candidate SHA. Every checkout sets `persist-credentials: false`, and the workflow verifies that no checkout Git credential remains.

The golden paths cover:

The deliberately weakened-validator case uses a localhost completion fixture
and a public dummy provider key. It deterministically requests one real DSH
Bash write, then the real Controller must reject the no-op entrypoint through
strict Validation Integrity. Docker, the credential proxy, tool receipts, and
all no-GitHub-mutation assertions remain active. This negative case must not
depend on a live model agreeing to disable a security verifier. CI separately
runs its frozen-SHA Docker regression without provider secrets; the other
controlled/native representative paths continue to use the real provider.

The live MCP smoke also requires a fresh opaque proof returned only by the
actual echo tool. The expected value stays in the Controller's temporary
endpoint file, outside the model prompt, schema and worker mounts. Exact
receipt/call-count and hidden-tool denial assertions remain mandatory; a model
summary is not execution evidence. Always-running diagnostics retain bounded
counts and proof equality plus a sanitized server audit, including on failure.

Fixture ref creation and deletion each send at most one write, followed by at
most five postcondition reads; deletion also performs one immediate identity
read before writing. The helper accepts only this run/attempt's checks refs
and the expected full commit SHA, within a 20-second total deadline and
5-second request caps. It may confirm an ambiguous transport, 404, or 5xx write
response through reads, but never resends the write. Different identities or
SHAs, unconfirmed reads, authentication/permission failures, quota responses,
and other definite write rejections fail the gate. The preceding commit, tree,
blob, Issue and PR ownership checks remain mandatory, and diagnostics contain
only operation, stage, HTTP status and attempt number.

| Credential isolation        | All candidate and harness checkouts use `persist-credentials: false` and have no residual Git auth configuration                                                                                                                                         |

The workflow also compares `main`, the candidate identity, PR/comments when
present, legacy `dsh/task-*` refs, and Controller-created task PRs on
no-mutation paths. Its
run-bound label, Issue, draft PR, comments, one-file fixture commit, and custom
ref are identity-verified and removed exactly before final candidate
revalidation. Cleanup handles each emitted identity independently, continues
after a per-fixture failure, and never performs a broad deletion.

Core E2E workflow and fixture code always comes from live trusted `main`, not
from the candidate checkout. Consequently, a PR that adds a new Core E2E step
cannot make that new secret-bearing step run before merge. Such a PR must add a
secretless exact-candidate-SHA CI smoke for the new native path, run the existing
complete controlled Core E2E from trusted `main` before merge, and then run the
new complete Core E2E in protected `main` mode after merge. Do not weaken the
main-only environment or immutable-workflow gate to avoid that sequencing.

Graceful cancellation is the verifiable path. `SIGKILL`, runner/host loss, a process crash, or GitHub API/network loss can prevent all finalizers from running; Core E2E must not claim otherwise.

If Core E2E finds a bug, fix it on the PR, obtain the new head SHA, update the variable, rerun CI, and dispatch Core E2E again. Never use an older candidate run as evidence for the new head.

## Merge and qualify `main`

After candidate CI and pre-merge Core E2E pass:

1. Reconfirm the PR head SHA has not moved.
2. Merge the PR into `main`.
3. Record the resulting full `main` SHA as `release_sha`.
4. Wait for the `push` CI run on that exact `main` SHA.
5. Verify the working tree and release metadata contain the expected version and generated bundle.
6. Set `DSH_E2E_CANDIDATE_SHA` to `release_sha` and run the complete protected Core E2E workflow in `main` mode:

   ```bash
   gh variable set DSH_E2E_CANDIDATE_SHA --body "$release_sha"
   gh workflow run e2e.yml --ref main \
     -f candidate_mode=main \
     -f candidate_sha="$release_sha"
   ```

7. Wait for every Core E2E job, including final candidate binding, to succeed against that exact SHA.

Do not tag while final `main` CI or post-merge Core E2E is pending or failing. If
`main` moves, the old run is not release evidence: record the new SHA, repeat
push CI and the complete `main`-mode Core E2E, and tag only that newly qualified
commit.

## Tag and GitHub Release

Create the release tag at the qualified `main` commit. An annotated tag is preferred because the canary deliberately resolves either annotated or lightweight tags to their final commit.

```bash
git tag -a "vX.Y.Z" "$release_sha" -m "vX.Y.Z"
git push origin "vX.Y.Z"
gh release create "vX.Y.Z" --verify-tag --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes-file release-notes.md
```

Release notes should summarize user-visible changes, security implications, compatibility, tests/E2E, performance evidence, and known limitations. Confirm the GitHub Release is neither draft nor prerelease unless that status is intentional for a non-final release.

## Release canary and formal tag smoke

The [release canary](../.github/workflows/release-canary.yml) runs every Wednesday at 05:17 UTC and can also be dispatched manually. Its secretless gate requires:

- `refs/heads/main`;
- the run SHA and workflow SHA to equal live `main`; and
- `main` to remain the default branch.

The protected `core-e2e` smoke job then checks that the configured release Tag, its non-draft/non-prerelease GitHub Release, and `DSH_RELEASE_CANARY_SHA` all resolve to the same commit. It checks out that immutable commit with `persist-credentials: false` and runs controlled-default and native read-only representative tasks with no
mutation scope. Both modes retain their outcome and bounded, redacted
diagnostics even if the first mode fails. The final gate requires both modes
and their schema/composition assertions to pass; continuing to collect evidence
does not turn a failure into a successful canary.

Set the variable to the formal tag's final commit and dispatch from `main`:

```bash
gh variable set DSH_RELEASE_CANARY_SHA --body "$release_sha"
gh workflow run release-canary.yml --ref main
```

Wait for the run and record its URL and conclusion. Pre-merge Core E2E, post-merge Core E2E, and `main` CI do not replace this formal-tag smoke; conversely, the two-mode post-release smoke does not replace full post-merge Core E2E before tagging.

If the smoke fails after publication, keep the tag immutable. Diagnose the failure, prepare the next patch release from `main`, and repeat the complete latest-SHA qualification flow.

## Publish the npm create package

Publish `create-deepseek-harness-action` only after the formal Action tag,
GitHub Release, and release canary all resolve to `release_sha`. A Git commit
cannot safely contain its own not-yet-known object ID, so the source package
uses one controlled build token. When an installer patch follows the Action
release, keep two identities: `release_sha` is the immutable Action commit
written into generated workflows, while `installer_source_sha` is the reviewed
commit containing the installer manifest, tests, and documentation. Create an
immutable `create-deepseek-harness-action-vX.Y.Z` source tag after CI succeeds
on that exact installer commit. Never move either tag or publish a tarball from
an unreviewed working tree, with an unresolved token, or with a floating Action
reference.

First verify the published Action release identity and the installer source tag,
then create a detached staging checkout. Each tag-resolution loop accepts an
annotated or lightweight tag and must end at its expected commit:

```bash
release_tag="v0.8.0"
release_sha="86fff4c4527694c7eefdc65c6cf7a633b5ea8cb1"
installer_tag="create-deepseek-harness-action-v0.2.0"

Pack with the verified SHA as the only production substitution input. The
package's pack step must reject a missing, uppercase, short, or otherwise
invalid value:

```bash
pack_json="$(
  DSH_ACTION_RELEASE_SHA="$release_sha" \
    npm pack "$installer_stage/source/packages/create-deepseek-harness-action" \
      --silent --json --pack-destination "$installer_stage/pack"
)"
tarball="$installer_stage/pack/$(jq -r '.[0].filename' <<<"$pack_json")"
test -f "$tarball"
tar -xzf "$tarball" -C "$installer_stage/unpacked"
```

Inspect the packed artifact, not only the source tree. It must contain version
`0.2.0`, expose the `create-deepseek-harness-action` executable, contain no
unresolved release token or floating Action reference, and generate controlled
and native workflows bound only to `release_sha`:

```bash
node --input-type=module - "$installer_stage/unpacked/package/package.json" <<'NODE'
import assert from "node:assert/strict";
import { readFile } from "node:fs/promises";

const manifest = JSON.parse(await readFile(process.argv[2], "utf8"));
assert.equal(manifest.name, "create-deepseek-harness-action");
assert.equal(manifest.version, "0.2.0");
assert.ok(manifest.bin?.["create-deepseek-harness-action"]);
NODE

```

Parse all four generated workflow files as YAML using the already-installed
repository `yaml` dependency. Confirm the controlled pair resolves the default
composition, the native pair explicitly selects `dsh-mode: native`, and every
file contains exactly one immutable Action reference. The deterministic test
suite separately covers all six `review|commands|both` × `controlled|native`
combinations.

Only after those checks pass, authenticate to the official npm registry and
publish that exact tarball. Do not publish from the source directory because
that would rerun packing with an unreviewed environment:

```bash
npm whoami --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
npm publish "$tarball" --access public --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
npm view create-deepseek-harness-action@0.2.0 \
  name version dist-tags --json --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

Stop if `npm whoami` fails; the configured default registry may be a mirror, so
every authentication, publish, view, and public consumer command must name the
official registry explicitly. After publication, create three new empty
directories and run representative consumers from the official package:

```bash
mkdir "$installer_stage/public-review" \
  "$installer_stage/public-commands-native" "$installer_stage/public-both"
(
  cd "$installer_stage/public-review"
  npm_config_registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/ \
    npm create deepseek-harness-action@0.2.0 -- --mode review
)
(
  cd "$installer_stage/public-commands-native"
  npm_config_registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/ \
    npm create deepseek-harness-action@0.2.0 -- --mode commands --dsh-mode native
)
(
  cd "$installer_stage/public-both"
  npm_config_registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/ \
    npm create deepseek-harness-action@0.2.0 -- --mode both
)
```

Confirm the review, commands, and both file sets are correct; controlled remains
the default; native is explicit; every workflow parses as YAML and contains
exactly one `release_sha` Action reference; and checkout, permission, Docker,
validation, credential, and overwrite boundaries remain intact. Then remove the
disposable worktree and staging directory. npm versions and both release tags
are immutable; a bad published installer must be fixed with a new installer
patch version rather than replacing `0.2.0`.
