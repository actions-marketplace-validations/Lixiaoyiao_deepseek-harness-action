Run DeepSeek Harness directly from GitHub pull requests, issues, failed CI jobs, and maintainer-authored automations.

```text
GitHub PR / Issue / CI  →  DeepSeek Harness  →  Review / Diagnose / Fix / Issue → PR
```

The Action starts a credential-isolated DSH worker, validates its structured result, and lets a trusted Controller publish comments or validated changes. This is a community project, not an official DeepSeek or GitHub product. It is maintained by [@Lixiaoyiao](https://github.com/Lixiaoyiao).

## Core capabilities

| Capability              | What it does                                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pull request review     | Reviews new commits, publishes one summary, and adds high-confidence inline findings                  |
| General tasks           | Answers repository questions or performs an explicitly authorized coding task                         |
| CI diagnosis and repair | Reads failed checks and logs; trusted workflows may validate and publish a fix                        |
| Issue implementation    | Turns an authorized Issue request into a validated branch and pull request                            |
| Composition modes       | Keeps the existing controlled tool profile by default and offers an experimental native DSH mode      |
| Controlled tools        | Adds exact profiles for native, fixed-command, typed Controller GitHub, MCP, Bundle, and Plugin tools |
| Structured results      | Keeps the schema-v1 audit envelope and can validate an optional maintainer-defined task result        |

v0.8.2 retains the experimental `dsh-mode: native` path over the locked DSH `0.1.1-rc.2` runtime and its official ecosystem composition. Native MCP servers, Profile Bundles, direct Cordis Plugins, repository Skills, Subagents, and Workflows retain DSH-native discovery and behavior. `controlled` remains the compatible default, so workflows that omit `dsh-mode` retain their existing composition, permissions, tools, budgets, receipts, and outputs.

Native mode is not an unsafe mode. It returns ownership of DSH's internal headless composition, capability graph, and model-visible inventory to DSH. Native MCP servers load through official `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client`; Bundles become official Profile layers; direct Plugins load through Cordis; and repository Skills, Subagents, and Workflows retain DSH-native behavior. Its definition-only extension schema declares owners and process requirements, not Action tools, grants, or per-tool budgets. Dynamic ecosystem tools appear only in runtime `observedTools`, and native `toolPolicy` never claims Controller `effectiveTools`.

The Action still owns trusted-workflow admission, exact package pins, lifecycle-script suppression, runtime inventory audit, Docker and `.git`-less workspace boundaries, the run-scoped DeepSeek credential proxy, GitHub credential isolation, actor/repository trust, validation and deferred writes, deadlines, cancellation, and secret redaction. Native remains Docker-only. Bridge network and read/write mounts are whole-worker capabilities, not per-extension or per-tool sandboxes. A user-configured GitHub MCP with its own credential is a trusted external extension whose direct effects do not receive the Controller Gateway's binding, revalidation, validation, or deferred-mutation guarantees. Controller-owned `command.*` and `github.*` capabilities remain a separate, mode-independent plane.

v0.8.2 fixes structured-result reliability in the production controlled/native paths and refreshes the advisory upstream compatibility checks. A bounded, tool-free result repair never reruns the worker task; strict output validation and all Controller write gates remain authoritative. Release canaries preserve diagnostics for both modes independently. Inputs, outputs, defaults, permissions, and the audited DSH `0.1.1-rc.2` pin remain compatible; this release adds no Session/Resume or new GitHub capability.

## Quick Start

Run the installer from the root of the repository you want to configure:

```bash
npm create deepseek-harness-action@latest
```

Choose one of these modes:

- **PR Review** creates `.github/workflows/dsh-review.yml`.
- **@dsh Coding Commands** creates `.github/workflows/dsh-commands.yml`.
- **Both** creates both workflow files.

For CI or another non-interactive environment, pass the mode explicitly so the installer never waits for stdin:

```bash
npm create deepseek-harness-action@latest -- --mode both
```

For non-interactive use, omitting `--dsh-mode` keeps the compatible `controlled`
default. The interactive flow asks explicitly; choose Controlled there unless
native composition is intended:

```bash
npm create deepseek-harness-action@latest -- --mode both --dsh-mode native
```

The installer creates `.github/workflows/` when needed and refuses to overwrite
an existing target workflow. It does not add secrets, commit or push changes,
or open a pull request. Installer v0.2.0 is built only from the formal v0.8.0
release identity and generates workflows pinned to immutable commit
`86fff4c4527694c7eefdc65c6cf7a633b5ea8cb1`, not a candidate SHA, floating tag,
or branch.

After installation, add `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**. Open or update a non-draft pull request to trigger Review. For Coding Commands, put an `@dsh` command on the first line of an Issue or pull request comment. See [Setup](docs/setup.md) for the complete onboarding and security guide.

### Manual installation

Add `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**, then create `.github/workflows/dsh-review.yml`:

```yaml
name: DSH review

on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, synchronize, ready_for_review, reopened]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  review:
    if: github.event.pull_request.draft == false
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 30
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@11d5960a326750d5838078e36cf38b85af677262 # v4
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}
          persist-credentials: false
          fetch-depth: 1
      - uses: Lixiaoyiao/deepseek-harness-action@v0.8.2
        with:
          deepseek-api-key: ${{ secrets.DEEPSEEK_API_KEY }}
          dsh-version: 0.1.1-rc.2
```

Open a non-draft pull request. The Action checks out only the trusted base SHA, reads the pull request through GitHub APIs, and never executes fork code.

For production, replace `v0.8.2` with the full immutable release commit SHA. See [Setup](docs/setup.md) for permissions, pinning, checkout rules, and complete templates.

## Common `@dsh` commands

Put the command on the first line of an Issue or pull request comment.

| Command                       | Purpose                                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `@dsh task --read <question>` | Explain code, inspect the repository, or answer a general question |
| `@dsh task --write <task>`    | Request a coding task; every write gate must still pass            |
| `@dsh review`                 | Review the current pull request again                              |
| `@dsh diagnose`               | Diagnose failed checks and logs                                    |
| `@dsh fix`                    | Repair a same-repository pull request in trusted write mode        |
| `@dsh implement`              | Implement an Issue and open a pull request                         |

`--write`, `fix`, and `implement` request capabilities; they do not grant them. The workflow must explicitly enable write mode and provide Controller-run validation. See [Usage](docs/usage.md) for commands and automation, and [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) for the gates.

Maintainers can change the trigger phrase, add label/assignee routes, filter actors or historical comments, select a base branch, and choose a deterministic branch template. These settings change routing and naming only; GitHub authority still comes from the Controller policy and workflow token scopes.

## Security

- The Agent receives neither the real `GITHUB_TOKEN` nor the real DeepSeek key. Only the Controller can call Action-owned `github.*` mutation APIs; an explicitly configured external GitHub MCP uses its own credential and authority as described below.
- Repository content, diffs, issues, pull requests, comments, logs, model output, and tool output remain untrusted data.
- Fork review uses a `.git`-less, credential-free worker and must check out only the trusted base SHA with `persist-credentials: false`.
- Writes require a trusted same-repository context, authorized actors, Docker, `allow-write: "true"`, non-empty fixed validation commands, and successful validation. Protected-path and Validation Integrity checks still apply.
- Typed `github.*` mutations are exact-ID, entity-bound, deferred until Controller validation, and reconciled with bounded receipts. No arbitrary REST, GraphQL, URL, or credential pass-through exists.
- Validation Integrity provides high-confidence weakening detection plus baseline replay for its supported entrypoints, scripts, test/config weakening, lock/toolchain controls, and known wrappers/interpreters; it is not complete cross-language dependency provenance or a formal proof.
- Validation may use Docker bridge networking. On self-hosted or corporate-network runners, repository validation code may reach runner-accessible network services; use dedicated runners and runner-level segmentation/egress controls.
- An approved Bundle, Plugin, or stdio MCP server is trusted worker code. Controlled ToolRuntime limits model-routed calls; native leaves routing and inventory to DSH. Neither model is a sandbox for extension startup, background work, or direct process I/O, and any bridge/RW capability applies to the whole worker.
- `github.*` uses the Controller GitHub Gateway. A separately configured GitHub MCP uses its own external credential and is outside the Gateway's binding, revalidation, validation, and deferred-write guarantees.

Read the complete [Security policy](SECURITY.md) before enabling write mode, host execution, network access, or third-party extensions.
